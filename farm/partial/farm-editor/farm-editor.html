This number should include the amount of nitrate naturally dissolved in the irrigation water as it is pumped out of the ground, or delivered to your ranch, block or field by the irrigation district, water agency, etc. This number should not include liquid fertilizers applied during fertigation. To report the average nitrate concentration you must obtain a laboratory analysis or utilize a portable measuring device that results in a discrete numeric result for nitrate concentration from the primary source of irrigation water applied to the ranch/risk unit, during the reporting period. For more accurate reporting, operators may also measure the nitrate concentration from the other sources of irrigation water applied, besides the primary source of irrigation water, to the ranch/risk unit, during the reporting period. In the case that more than one well is used to irrigate, each wellï¿½s average annual concentration and volume applied could be measured to obtain the weighted averages. Therefore, if more than one irrigation source is used, the weighted averages could be reported instead of information from only the primary source of irrigation water. Note 1: A discrete measurement is required for the primary source of irrigation water applied. However, any methodology, such as nitrate quick test, can be used to measure the concentration of all other sources of irrigation water applied, e.g. backup wells. Note 2: mg/L = ppm.">

The information must be reported as the total pounds of nitrogen applied to each acre of the ranch, risk unit, or block/field. To report the amount of nitrogen applied with irrigation water (to all the crops grown on the ranch or risk unit during the reporting period), the following information must be known: 1. The average nitrate concentration in the primary source of irrigation water, or the weighted average of nitrate concentration in the irrigation water applied, if more than one well is used for irrigation. 2. Total volume of irrigation water applied (to all the crops grown on the ranch, risk unit or block/field during the reporting period). To calculate the total amount of nitrogen applied with irrigation water in lbs/acre, in cases where more than one water source is used to irrigate crops in the ranch/risk unit or block/field, the volume of water applied from each source should be accurately measured. The Nitrogen Applied with Irrigation Water can be manually calculated by following the steps outlined in the example described on pages 9 and 10. To auto-calculate, enter the total volume of irrigation water applied, in gallons (previous box) to the entire ranch, risk unit or block/field (reporting acres).
